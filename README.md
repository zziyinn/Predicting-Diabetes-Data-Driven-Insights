# Diabetes Risk Prediction and Early Detection

This project explores strategies for **type 2 diabetes prevention and early detection** using the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset. Diabetes is a major public health issue, and we aim to address it by asking deeper, action-oriented questions.

## Project Goals

1. **Identify Key Risk Factors**
   What features most influence the detection of type 2 diabetes? By analyzing indicators like BMI, physical activity, diet, and healthcare access, we aim to uncover the strongest predictors and inform prevention strategies.

2. **Build a Predictive Model for Early Detection**
   How can we train and evaluate a model to effectively identify patients for early intervention? Early diagnosis enables lifestyle changes and timely treatment to prevent long-term complications.

## Impact

* Empower individuals to make healthier choices based on risk factors
* Support community-level interventions like improving access to exercise and healthy food
* Deploy predictive models in healthcare settings, especially in underserved communities

---

## Dataset

* **Source**: CDC Diabetes Health Indicators
* **Features**: Physical activity, BMI, age, gender, socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, etc.

## Methods

* Data preprocessing and feature selection
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Machine learning models for classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
* Evaluation metrics: accuracy, recall, precision, ROC-AUC

---

## Tools Used

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebook
